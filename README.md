# Simple Journey

Corporate website for **Simple Journey**, an IT solutions company. Built as a single-page
application covering home, services, products, careers, about, and contact pages, with a
floating chat widget that offers direct contact channels (live chat, phone, email, SMS).

- Fully responsive from 360px phones up to wide desktops
- Scroll-driven animations and pinned sections on the home page

## Requirements

- **Node.js** `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0` — required by Vite 8. Verified on Node 24.18.1.
- **npm** 10 or newer (bundled with Node.js).

Check your version:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bayunc2212-max/simple-journey.git
cd simple-journey
npm install
```

## Running the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site is served at **http://localhost:5173** with hot module replacement — edits to `.vue`,
`.js`, and `.css` files apply instantly in the browser.

The dev server also binds to your local network (`server.host: true` in `vite.config.js`).
That means you can open the site from a phone on the same Wi-Fi to check mobile layouts, and
use the printed LAN address in the terminal.

### Available Scripts

| Script | Command | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dev` | `vite` | Start the development server with hot module replacement |
| `build` | `vite build` | Build the production bundle into `dist/` |
| `preview` | `vite preview` | Serve the production build locally to verify it |

## Routes

All routes are defined in `src/router/index.js`.

| Path | Name | View |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `Home` | `views/Home.vue` |
| `/services` | `Services` | `views/Services.vue` |
| `/products` | `Products` | `views/Products.vue` |
| `/products/:name` | `ProductDetail` | `views/ProductDetail.vue` |
| `/about` | `About` | `views/About.vue` |
| `/career` | `Career` | `views/Career.vue` |
| `/career/:position` | `CareerDetail` | `views/CareerDetail.vue` |
| `/contact` | `Contact` | `views/Contact.vue` |
| `/privacy-policy` | `PrivacyPolicy` | `views/PrivacyPolicy.vue` |
| `/:pathMatch(.*)*` | `NotFound` | `views/NotFound.vue` |

## Production Build

Create an optimised production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output is written to `dist/`. Vite fingerprints filenames, so `dist/index.html` should be
deployed as-is alongside the rest of `dist/`.

Preview the built output before deploying:

```bash
npm run preview
```
